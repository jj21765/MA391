#rainy day problem
#if day is rainy, 75% chance that the next day will be rainy. 
#if day is sunny, 75% chance that the next day will be sunny.
#day zero was sunny.
#Model as a markov chain and determine steady state probability that any future day will be rainy.
#part a: determine the steady state probability that any future day will be rainy
